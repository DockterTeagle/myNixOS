# CHANGELOG/RESOLVED TODOS

- \[x\] config hyprpaper or swww
  - using stylix
- \[x\] config mako
  - using hyprpanel for now
- \[x\] sort remaining packages in zsh.nix and configuration.nix into their
  respective packages
- \[x\] find a way to only have one version of hyprland installed as currently
  there is two, one in home and one in system
  - fixed by setting to null in home-manager
- \[x\] make hyprland have tmux like leader key
  - fixed awhile ago
- \[x\] wait for ghostty to fix cpu error
- \[x\] check if transient prompt is possible in starship and if it is enable it
  - only possible with fish
- \[x\] move basically all of tools into their own separate flakes
- \[ \] configure this to set WSL auto
  - not exactly done yet, but is satisfactory for now
